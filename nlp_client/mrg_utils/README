This is a set of python classes for processing Penn-Treebank-style combined parses, 
also known as the .mrg format in PTB release two.  Files should be fairly self-explanatory.  

Canonical node is mrg_utils.py, but mrg_document.py and node.py may be more informative 
for someone starting out.

This could save you up to a month of writing and debugging, and was designed to be scalable.

You can use this to extract features, easily run statistics, and navigate syntactic trees.

This code is built from an API originally designed to interface with Stanford Parser-style dependency 
parse outputs (Marneffe et al, 2006), Penn Discourse Treebank data, and more.  Code or 
guidance will be furnished upon request by emailing me at robert.elwell@gmail.com.

Good luck, and enjoy.
